# Nx Plugin for Building Angular with Rspack

The goal of `@ng-rspack/nx` is to make easy and straightforward to build Angular applications with [rspack](https://rspack.dev).

### Current Status: POC

Currently, this is still being viewed as a proof-of-concept.

There needs to be a lot more comprehensive testing before this is viable for real applications.
